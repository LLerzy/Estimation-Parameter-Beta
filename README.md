## Overview

This project contains a set of routines aimed at estimating the shape parameters of the Beta distribution for the variable $X$ from a Bayesian perspective. Although a new bivariate prior distribution and its respective method for simulating random samples are used (which can be found in the [**Algorithm-Sim-Samples**](https://github.com/LLerzy/Estimation-Parameter-Beta/tree/Algorithm-Sim-Samples) branch), the main goal is to develop a simulation study to monitor the behavior of the estimates obtained for these parameters.

The script includes both empirical and subjective Bayesian approaches for the estimation of hyperparameters, using bootstrap intervals and expert intervals with different biases and semi-widths. All the code is written in R-Project, taking advantage of the statistical and computational tools of this software. The project includes both numerical and theoretical results.

## Installation

To run the code, you need to have `R` installed with the following packages:

- `ggplot2` 
- `gridExtra` 
- `tidyr` 
- `plotly` 
- `coda` 
- `foreach` 
- `doParallel` 
- `betafunctions` 
- `openxlsx` 
- `xtable`

You can install the required packages using the following command:

``` r
install.packages(c("ggplot2", "gridExtra", "tidyr","plotly","coda","foreach","doParallel","betafunctions","openxlsx","xtable"))
```

## Usage

To replicate the analysis and run the algorithms, follow these steps:

1.  Clone this repository:

    ``` bash
    git clone https://github.com/LLerzy/Estimation-Parameter-Beta/tree/Post-Estimate.git
    ```

2.  Open the R script in any compatible Integrated Development Environment (IDE):

    -   For the script containing the main functions, refer to [`requiredfunctions.R`](https://github.com/LLerzy/Estimation-Parameter-Beta/blob/Post-Estimate/requiredfunctions.R).
    -   For the script containing the simulation study sequences, refer to [`Post_Estimation_Beta_Param.R`](https://github.com/LLerzy/Estimation-Parameter-Beta/blob/Post-Estimate/Post_Estimation_Beta_Param.R).

3.  The script can be executed using the following command; however, it is necessary to adjust certain parameters in the code beforehand.

    ``` bash
    Rscript Post_Estimation_Beta_Param.R
    ```

The code considers three scenarios for the shape parameters of the Beta distribution and establishes different biases for the level of information from hypothetical experts. The results generated by the code involve both empirical Bayesian and subjective approaches. These results include: a matrix of hyperparameter values, a matrix of (theoretical) estimates of the prior distributions, graphs of the posterior estimates generated by importance sampling, and characteristics of the posterior estimators (mean estimate, bias, mean squared error, coverage probability, average length).

## Files and Documents

-   [`Post_Estimation_Beta_Param.R`](Post_Estimation_Beta_Param.R): Contains the code used to obtain the simulation study results for the posterior estimation of the shape parameters of the Beta distribution, considering a new bivariate prior distribution and a proposed methodology for obtaining hyperparameter values.
-   [`requiredfunctions.R`](requiredfunctions.R): Contains the custom functions used in the simulation study.
-   [`Results_Post_Estim/`](https://github.com/LLerzy/Estimation-Parameter-Beta/tree/Post-Estimate/Results_Post_Estim): Folder containing two subfolders: one stores the figures generated for monitoring the characteristics of the posterior estimators, and the other contains spreadsheets with the hyperparameter values along with the chains used to construct the previously described graphs.

### Key Figures and Documents:

-   **Posterior Estimates Generated for Scenario $\alpha=0.5$ and $\beta=0.5$**: See the generated figure [`Alpha-Escenario1.png`](https://github.com/LLerzy/Estimation-Parameter-Beta/blob/Post-Estimate/Results_Post_Estim/Graphics/ParAlphaSigMu01SigV01Scen-1.png) for the results obtained for the parameter $\alpha$ and the figure [`Beta-Escenario1.png`](https://github.com/LLerzy/Estimation-Parameter-Beta/blob/Post-Estimate/Results_Post_Estim/Graphics/ParBetaSigMu01SigV01Scen-1.png) for the results of $\beta$.
-   **Supplement 1**: A PDF file, [`Max-IC-Varianza`](https://github.com/LLerzy/Estimation-Parameter-Beta/blob/Post-Estimate/Results_Post_Estim/Supplement1.pdf), contains the results obtained for the posterior estimates when considering the variance is bounded by the upper limit of the quantile interval provided by the expert or the empirical Bayesian approach.
