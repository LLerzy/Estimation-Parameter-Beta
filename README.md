## Overview

This branch contains a set of routines designed to estimate the shape parameters of the Beta distribution for the random variable \(X\) from a Bayesian perspective. The methodology is based on a new bivariate prior distribution for the mean and variance, given by:  

$$f_{\mu,\sigma^2}(u,v|\phi=(a,b,c,d))=\dfrac{1}{\text{beta}(a,b) \text{beta}(c,d)} \dfrac{v^{c-1} (u (1-u)-v)^{d-1}}{u^{c+d-a} (1-u)^{c+d-b} },$$

along with a corresponding method for generating random samples, which can be found in the [**Algorithm-Sim-Samples**](https://github.com/LLerzy/Estimation-Parameter-Beta/tree/Algorithm-Sim-Samples) branch.  

The main objective of this branch is to conduct a simulation study to analyze the behavior of the estimations obtained for these parameters.  

The scripts include both empirical and subjective Bayesian approaches for hyperparameter estimation, utilizing bootstrap intervals as well as expert-defined intervals with different biases and semi-amplitudes.  

All code is written in **R-Project**, leveraging the statistical and computational tools available in this software. The project provides both numerical and theoretical results.  


## Installation

To run the code, you need to have `R` installed with the following packages:

- `ggplot2` 
- `gridExtra` 
- `tidyr` 
- `plotly` 
- `coda` 
- `foreach` 
- `doParallel` 
- `betafunctions` 
- `openxlsx` 
- `xtable`

You can install the required packages using the following command:

``` r
install.packages(c("ggplot2", "gridExtra", "tidyr","plotly","coda","foreach","doParallel","betafunctions","openxlsx","xtable"))
```

## Usage

To run the designed algorithms, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:

    ``` bash
    git clone https://github.com/LLerzy/Estimation-Parameter-Beta/tree/Post-Estimate-2.git
    ```

2. Open the R script in any compatible Integrated Development Environment (IDE):

    -   For the script that contains the main functions in the shape parameter estimation process, refer to [`requiredfunctions.R`](https://github.com/LLerzy/Estimation-Parameter-Beta/blob/Post-Estimate-2/requiredfunctions.R).
    -   For the script containing the sequences related to the simulation study, see: [`Post_Estimation_Beta_Mom.R`](https://github.com/LLerzy/Estimation-Parameter-Beta/blob/Post-Estimate-2/Post_Estimation_Beta_Mom.R).

3. The script can be executed using the following command; however, it is necessary to adjust certain parameters in the code beforehand.

    ``` bash
    Rscript Post_Estimation_Beta_Mom.R
    ```
The code follows the same scenarios as in the [**Post-Estimate**](https://github.com/LLerzy/Estimation-Parameter-Beta/tree/Post-Estimate) branch. These scenarios consist of three different configurations for the shape parameters of the Beta distribution, each considering varying degrees of bias in the information provided by hypothetical experts.  

The results generated by the code incorporate both the **empirical Bayesian approach** and the **subjective Bayesian approach**. Specifically, the output includes:  

- **Matrix of hyperparameter values**,  
- **Matrix of (theoretical) prior distribution estimates**,  
- **Graphs of posterior estimates** obtained via the importance sampling method,  
- **Posterior estimator characteristics**, including:  
  - Mean estimate,  
  - Bias,  
  - Mean squared error (MSE),  
  - Coverage probability,  
  - Average length.  

## Included Functions

The functions defined in the `requiredfunctions.R` script include:

-   `Hyperparameters`: Obtains hyperparameter values using empirical and subjective Bayesian approaches.
-   `Est_Post`: Posterior estimation of the Beta distribution's shape parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ using importance sampling.

-   `Sim_study_MS`: Conducts simulation studies to compare posterior estimates using different hyperparameters and sample sizes.
-   Parall_sim_study_MS
Graphs_Comparison_Hyper_MS


-   `Individual_Graphs`: Creates individual graphs to monitor posterior estimates using bias and MSE as indicators.
-   `Comparison_Hyper`: Compares joint density functions for different sets of hyperparameters.

### Notes:

-   It is recommended to review and adapt each function according to the specific needs of each analysis.
-   Make sure you understand each function before using it to ensure accurate results and avoid potential errors.

## Branches

The following branches are available in this repository:

-   [**New-Biv-Dist**](https://github.com/LLerzy/Estimation-Parameter-Beta/tree/New-Biv-Dist): Presents numerically approximated characteristics for seven of the 25 proposed probability distributions representing the random behavior of the Beta distributionâ€™s shape parameters. Additionally, some numerical and theoretical approximations for combination 1 are compared.
-   [**Algorithm-Sim-Samples**](https://github.com/LLerzy/Estimation-Parameter-Beta/tree/Algorithm-Sim-Samples): Monitors the convergence of chains generated by an algorithm using MCMC methods to generate random samples from a new proposed probability distribution, referred to as combination 1 in the [New-Biv-Dist](https://github.com/LLerzy/Estimation-Parameter-Beta/tree/New-Biv-Dist) branch.
-   [**Post-Estimate**](https://github.com/LLerzy/Estimation-Parameter-Beta/tree/Post-Estimate): Conducts a simulation study to estimate the shape parameters of the Beta distribution. This study involves: two questions that can be used in an elicitation process, hyperparameter determination methods, three scenarios for the shape parameters, hypothetical expert information with different levels of bias, and graphs comparing posterior estimators through mean estimation, bias, mean squared error, coverage probability, and average length.
