## Overview

This branch contains a set of routines designed to estimate the shape parameters of the Beta distribution for the random variable \(X\) from a Bayesian perspective. The methodology is based on a new bivariate prior distribution for the mean and variance, given by:  

$$f_{\mu,\sigma^2}(u,v|\phi=(a,b,c,d))=\dfrac{1}{\text{beta}(a,b) \text{beta}(c,d)} \dfrac{v^{c-1} (u (1-u)-v)^{d-1}}{u^{c+d-a} (1-u)^{c+d-b} },$$

along with a corresponding method for generating random samples, which can be found in the [**Algorithm-Sim-Samples**](https://github.com/LLerzy/Estimation-Parameter-Beta/tree/Algorithm-Sim-Samples) branch.  

The main objective of this branch is to conduct a simulation study to analyze the behavior of the estimations obtained for these parameters.  

The scripts include both empirical and subjective Bayesian approaches for hyperparameter estimation, utilizing bootstrap intervals as well as expert-defined intervals with different biases and semi-amplitudes.  

All code is written in **R-Project**, leveraging the statistical and computational tools available in this software. The project provides both numerical and theoretical results.  


## Installation

To run the code, you need to have `R` installed with the following packages:

- `ggplot2` 
- `gridExtra` 
- `tidyr` 
- `plotly` 
- `coda` 
- `foreach` 
- `doParallel` 
- `betafunctions` 
- `openxlsx` 
- `xtable`

You can install the required packages using the following command:

``` r
install.packages(c("ggplot2", "gridExtra", "tidyr","plotly","coda","foreach","doParallel","betafunctions","openxlsx","xtable"))
```

## Usage

To run the designed algorithms, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:

    ``` bash
    git clone https://github.com/LLerzy/Estimation-Parameter-Beta/tree/Post-Estimate-2.git
    ```

2. Open the R script in any compatible Integrated Development Environment (IDE):

    -   For the script that contains the main functions in the shape parameter estimation process, refer to [`requiredfunctions.R`](https://github.com/LLerzy/Estimation-Parameter-Beta/blob/Post-Estimate-2/requiredfunctions.R).
    -   For the script containing the sequences related to the simulation study, see: [`Post_Estimation_Beta_Mom.R`](https://github.com/LLerzy/Estimation-Parameter-Beta/blob/Post-Estimate-2/Post_Estimation_Beta_Mom.R).

3. The script can be executed using the following command; however, it is necessary to adjust certain parameters in the code beforehand.

    ``` bash
    Rscript Post_Estimation_Beta_Mom.R
    ```
The code follows the same scenarios as in the [**Post-Estimate**](https://github.com/LLerzy/Estimation-Parameter-Beta/tree/Post-Estimate) branch. These scenarios consist of three different configurations for the shape parameters of the Beta distribution, each considering varying degrees of bias in the information provided by hypothetical experts.  

The results generated by the code incorporate both the **empirical Bayesian approach** and the **subjective Bayesian approach**. Specifically, the output includes:  

- **Matrix of hyperparameter values**,  
- **Matrix of (theoretical) prior distribution estimates**,  
- **Graphs of posterior estimates** obtained via the importance sampling method,  
- **Posterior estimator characteristics**, including:  
  - Mean estimate,  
  - Bias,  
  - Mean squared error (MSE),  
  - Coverage probability,  
  - Average length.  

## Included Functions

In the script `Post_Estimation_Beta_Mom.R`, additional functions are defined:  

- **`Sim_study_MS`**: Conducts simulation studies to compare posterior estimates using different hyperparameters and sample sizes. It first estimates the mean and variance, and then derives the posterior estimates for the shape parameters.  
- **`Parall_sim_study_MS`**: Parallelizes the **`Sim_study_MS`** function to improve computational efficiency.  
- **`Graphs_Comparison_Hyper_MS`**: Generates comparative plots between the direct estimates of the shape parameters and those obtained by first estimating the mean and variance.
